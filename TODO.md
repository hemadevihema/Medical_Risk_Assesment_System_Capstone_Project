# TODO: Enhance BodyRiskMap Component

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Update bodyParts array to include more organs (lungs, stomach, liver, intestines) with SVG path data
- [x] Change rendering from ellipses to <path> elements for realism
- [x] Add framer-motion animations: breathing (scale oscillation) for lungs, beating for heart, subtle movements for others
- [x] Update riskColors to use gradient fills (e.g., fill="url(#gradient-low)")
- [x] Add SVG defs for gradients in the component
- [x] Modify pulse-glow animation for high risk to include dark red pulse
- [x] Add a face/emoji above the body that changes expression based on risk level with messages (e.g., sad face for high risk, happy for low)
- [x] Ensure animations are smooth and responsive
- [x] Test the component in browser
